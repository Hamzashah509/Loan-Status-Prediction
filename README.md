#Loan Status Prediction using SVM

This project demonstrates the use of Support Vector Machines (SVM) for predicting loan approval status. SVM is a powerful classification algorithm widely used for binary classification tasks.

Project Overview
In this project, we aim to predict whether a loan application will be approved or not based on certain input features. We use the SVM algorithm for this binary classification task.

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains information about loan applicants, including various attributes such as gender, income, credit history, loan amount, and more.

Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: The dataset is cleaned and preprocessed. Missing values are handled, and categorical variables are converted to numerical form.

Feature Selection: Relevant features are selected for training the SVM model.

Model Training: The SVM model is trained using the selected features and the target variable (loan approval status).

Model Evaluation: The model's performance is evaluated using accuracy metrics on both training and testing data.

Prediction: Given a new set of input features, the trained SVM model predicts whether a loan application will be approved or not.

Usage
Install the necessary libraries using pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas.

Download the dataset and store it as a CSV file (e.g., loan_data.csv).

Run the Python script loan_status_prediction.py to train the SVM model, evaluate its performance, and perform predictions.

To predict loan approval status for a specific set of input features, call the predict_loan_status function and pass the input features as arguments.

Results
The trained SVM model achieves a certain level of accuracy on the testing dataset. This project demonstrates how SVM can be used to make loan approval predictions based on applicant attributes.

Conclusion
The SVM algorithm is a robust tool for binary classification tasks like loan approval prediction. By using this project as a starting point, you can explore further improvements, fine-tuning the model, and incorporating additional features to enhance prediction accuracy.

Feel free to contribute to this project by experimenting with different SVM kernels, trying different feature combinations, or implementing additional evaluation metrics.
